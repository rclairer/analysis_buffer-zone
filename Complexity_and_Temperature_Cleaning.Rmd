This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Set working directory
```{r working_directory}
setwd("C:/Users/rclairer/Dropbox (Paxton)/Paxton Team Folder/CRFL - Artificial Reefs/Buffer_Zone/Analysis_Buffer-Zone")
```

Import packages

```{r library}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r, read_file_compexity}

  comp <- read.csv("Complexity/3_Clean_Data/complexity.csv")
```

Fitler and clean file
```{r, clean_data_compexity}
  
comp$Site <- revalue(comp$Site, c("AR-330" = "330", "AR-342" = "342", "AR-345" = "345", "AR-364" = "364", "AR-370" = "370", "AR-372" = "372", "AR-378" = "378"))
comp$Transect_Type <- revalue(comp$Transect_Type, c("R" = "Radiating", "S" = "Structural"))
comp$Transect_Number <- revalue(comp$Transect_Number, c("T1" = "1", "T2" = "2", "T2_T3" = "2_3", "T3" = "3"))

comp <- filter(comp, Subsite != "UNK")
comp <- filter(comp, ID != "AR-330_BARGE_2015-12-11_R_T2_T3")
comp <- filter(comp, ID != "AR-345_PIPES_2015-08-10_S")

comp$Transect_Number <- as.numeric(as.character(comp$Transect_Number))
comp$Transect_Number [is.na(comp$Transect_Number)] <- 0

```


```{r, export_compexity}

# Export information in a csv file
  write.csv(comp, file = "Complexity/3_Clean_Data/comp_site_change.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


```{r, read_file_temperature}

```

Fitler and clean file
```{r, clean_data_temperature}
